# FPCVT

Convert floating point to packed binary format which can live in a fully Unicode compliant string - use when pure Float64Array-like binary storage is not an option or when storage space is costly (many values are stored in one 16 bit word)



# Development History Notes

Most of the initial work was done in the GerHobbelt/Benchmark and GerHobbelt/gonzo-research repositories.

All the FPCVT work has been extracted from these repositories and rebased into this repo.
